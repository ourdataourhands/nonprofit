# The non-profit
This is where we keep everything about the [Our Data Our Hands](https://ourdataourhands.org/) non-profit - the intention is to do everything relating to it in the open as we evolve on our mission to put all public scientific data in public hands.

Keep tabs on what we are doing right now in the [open issues for this repo](https://github.com/ourdataourhands/non-profit/issues) and eventually we'll have documentation, articles of incorporation, minutes, etc in the attached [wiki](https://github.com/ourdataourhands/non-profit/wiki).
